# Introduction

RbxSync is a professional tool for syncing Roblox games between Studio and VS Code with full property preservation, git integration, and AI-powered development workflows.

## What Makes RbxSync Different?

- **No More Workspace Discrepancies**: Everyone syncs from Git. No more "which version is the latest?"
- **Full Property Extraction**: Captures ALL properties (not just scripts) using API dump reflection
- **Two-Way Sync**: Changes in Studio automatically sync back to files
- **AI-Powered Development**: MCP integration lets AI agents write, test, and debug code

## Components

RbxSync consists of three components:

1. **CLI** - Command-line tool for project management, building, and server operations
2. **Studio Plugin** - Connects Roblox Studio to the sync server
3. **VS Code Extension** - IDE integration with console streaming and E2E testing
